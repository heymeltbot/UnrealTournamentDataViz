# Unreal Tournament Data Visualization
This code showcases weapons used during a tournament of the game "Unreal Tournament". The data is displayed using D3, Javascript, HTML, Node.js, Docker, Ajax, and Json.

Directions for use:
1. Using Terminal or Console, open the cloned git repository within your preferred text editor (I use Visual Studio Code).
2. Make sure you have Docker running
3. Within Terminal, proceed to the UnrealTournamentDataViz program that you have cloned/downloaded, and proceed to the utstats-docker-info folder
4. Once inside, type  `docker-compose up -d`
5. Once Docker has finished in terminal, open a new terminal window and navigate the UnrealTournamentDataViz program once more.
6. Once inside the main program, type `http-server`
7. You will receive an address to type into your web browser, which should look something like http://1111.11.0.220:8080
8. attach /dataviz to the end of the web address you were provided so that it looks like http://1111.11.0.220:8080/dataviz
9. This should allow you to see the hard coded data and images that are housed within the program
